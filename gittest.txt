('git push' failed. -- Update was rejected, since remote contains work that does not exist on local.)
See 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

remote commit and local commit were separated, could not push from local,
on local, need to fetch remote,
pull remote commit head and resolve conflicts with local head, then merged on local.

check if there's an update on remote everytime, fetch remote, check diffs, merge it on local with caution.

or branch it.
